# AnalogClock
C# Windows Form Application Analog clock. It is still a work in progress and has a couple of kinks I have to figure out and fix.
Any and all help or advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 
I am a newbie and am still learning all things computer science.
So please be patient when explaining something to me because I take LOTS of notes and the "lingo" used when talking about programming languages really stumps me sometimes.
